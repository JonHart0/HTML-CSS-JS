Learning to use Github

Pandora's Box is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript based game. 
I was inspired by the Candy Box games (ascii based game), this led me to learn to web-based code (HTML-CSS-JS)
 
 
 
 
Features currently implemented:

*Currency is 90% working (current bug when buying too many items too quickly will lead to negative currency, this should not occur in normal play)

*Shop is working, with the structure setup for easy addition of new items

*Equiping items is working, with room to add new types of items
